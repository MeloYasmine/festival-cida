## Project Overview
A single-page landing page application designed specifically to serve as a demonstration for a presentation. The page will feature a beautiful background with the text "1º Festival CIDA - Ciência, Design & Ancestralidade!" showcasing modern Angular best practices (Angular v19+) such as Signals, Standalone Components, and Material Design theming.

## Core Requirements
- **Single Page Application:** Beautiful landing page with Festival CIDA branding.
- **Modern Angular Architecture:**
  - Standalone Components (No NgModules).
  - Signals for state management (if needed for interactions/animations).
  - Angular Material with custom theming.
  - Clean component structure (App -> Hero/Home component).
- **Visual Design:**
  - Purple background (rich, textured gradient inspired by Festival CIDA poster).
  - Yellow accents for highlights.
  - White text for readability.
  - Modern, vibrant graphic design aesthetic.

## Success Criteria
- Codebase serves as a clear, clean reference for "Modern Angular".
- Successfully demonstrates:
  1.  Standalone Components architecture.
  2.  Angular Material custom theming.
  3.  Clean, maintainable component structure.
- Beautiful visual presentation matching Festival CIDA brand identity.
- Application runs error-free during the presentation.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Landing page with hero section and title.
- Custom Material theme matching Festival CIDA colors (purple, yellow, white).
- Clean, well-commented code explaining "Why this way?" for the presentation.
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly).

### Out of Scope
- Complex backend integration (mock data will suffice).
- Authentication/Authorization (unless needed for a specific demo point).
- Legacy migration patterns (focus is pure new greenfield approach).

## Timeline
- **Immediate:** Setup and core implementation for upcoming presentation.

## Stakeholders
- **Presenter:** User demonstrating the code.
- **Audience:** Developers/Technical staff learning about modern Angular.
