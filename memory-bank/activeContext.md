# Active Context: Festival CIDA Landing Page
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-12-03*
*Last Updated: 2025-12-03*
*Current RIPER Mode: NONE (START Phase)*

## Current Focus
Completing the START Phase initialization. The project structure is set up with:
- Angular 20 with Standalone Components
- Angular Material with custom Festival CIDA theme (purple, yellow, white)
- Hero component created with beautiful gradient background
- Modern architecture demonstrating best practices

## Recent Changes
- **2025-12-03:** Project initialized with CursorRIPER Framework
- **2025-12-03:** Angular Material installed and configured
- **2025-12-03:** Hero component created with Festival CIDA branding
- **2025-12-03:** Custom Material theme configured with Festival CIDA color palette

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture:** Standalone Components (no NgModules) - ✅ Decided
- **UI Library:** Angular Material with custom theming - ✅ Decided
- **Zoneless:** Not using (standard Zone.js) - ✅ Decided
- **Component Structure:** App -> Hero (simple, clean) - ✅ Decided

## Next Steps
1. Complete START Phase (Memory Bank initialization)
2. Test the application (`ng serve`)
3. Fine-tune visual design if needed
4. Prepare for presentation

## Current Challenges
- None at the moment - setup is proceeding smoothly
